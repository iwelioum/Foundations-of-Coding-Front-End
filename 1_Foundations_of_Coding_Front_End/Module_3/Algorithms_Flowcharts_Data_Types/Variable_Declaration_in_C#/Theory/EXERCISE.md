# Activity: Declaring, Initializing, and Assigning Variables in C#

## Objective

Reinforce understanding of variable declaration, initialization, and assignment in C# by completing code blocks with appropriate syntax and assigning values to different data types.

## Description

In this activity, you'll practice declaring and initializing variables in C#. You will work with different data types, including integers, strings, doubles, and booleans. The goal is to strengthen your understanding of variable declaration and assignment through practical examples such as storing a product price or a user's admin status.

## Example 1: Declaring and Initializing an Integer Variable

### Problem Statement

We need to declare a variable to store the number of students in a classroom and assign it an initial value of 25.

### 1. Explanation

**Step 1: Choosing the Data Type**
- Since the number of students is a whole number, an integer (`int`) is an appropriate data type.

**Step 2: Declaring the Variable**
- In C#, you declare a variable by specifying the data type, followed by the variable name. In this case, `int numberOfStudents`.

**Step 3: Initializing the Variable**
- Initialization is the process of assigning an initial value to a variable at the time of declaration. We assign the value 25 to `numberOfStudents` using the assignment operator `=`.

### 2. Code Example

```csharp
int numberOfStudents = 25;
```

### 3. Explanation of the Code

- `int` specifies the data type as an integer.
- `numberOfStudents` is the name of the variable.
- `=` is the assignment operator.
- `25` is the value assigned to `numberOfStudents`.

## Example 2: Declaring and Initializing a String Variable

### Problem Statement

We need to store the name of a course in a variable and assign it an initial value of "Introduction to Programming".

### 1. Explanation

**Step 1: Choosing the Data Type**
- Since a course name consists of text, a string (`string`) is the appropriate data type.

**Step 2: Declaring the Variable**
- In C#, you declare a string variable by specifying the data type `string` and then the variable name. In this example, `string courseName`.

**Step 3: Initializing the Variable**
- We assign the text "Introduction to Programming" to `courseName`. Text values are enclosed in double quotes.

### 2. Code Example

```csharp
string courseName = "Introduction to Programming";
```

### 3. Explanation of the Code

- `string` specifies the data type as a string, which can store text.
- `courseName` is the name of the variable.
- `=` is the assignment operator.
- `"Introduction to Programming"` is the string value assigned to `courseName`. The text is enclosed in double quotes to indicate it is a string.

## Student Problems to Solve

### Problem 1: Declaring and Initializing a Double Variable

#### Problem Statement

Declare a variable to store the price of a product and initialize it with a value of 49.99.

#### Instructions

1. Identify the appropriate data type for the variable.
2. Declare the variable with an appropriate name.
3. Initialize the variable with the value 49.99.

#### Code Template

```csharp
____ productPrice = ____;
```

### Problem 2: Declaring and Initializing a Boolean Variable

#### Problem Statement

Declare a variable to store a flag indicating whether a user is an admin, and initialize it with the value `true`.

#### Instructions

1. Identify the appropriate data type for the variable.
2. Declare the variable with an appropriate name.
3. Initialize the variable with the value `true`.

#### Code Template

```csharp
____ isAdmin = ____;
```
