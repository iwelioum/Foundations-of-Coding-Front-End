Integrated Use of Control Structures and Loops

Objective:

By the end of this activity, you will be able to combine if-else and switch control structures with loops to solve practical coding problems. They will write simple programs that integrate these structures to handle decision-making within loops.
Step 1: Integrating If-Else with Loops

Create a program that repeatedly asks the user to input a number between 1 and 10 and ensures the number is even. The loop should continue until the user enters a valid input using an if-else statement to check the validity.

Instructions:

    Use a do-while loop to continuously prompt the user for an even number between 1 and 10.

    Inside the loop, use an if-else statement to validate whether the number is even and between 1 and 10.

    If the input is valid, print the number and exit the loop using the break statement. If it’s invalid, display an error message and repeat the prompt.

Step 2: Using If-Else to Evaluate Grades

Write a program that uses a for loop and an if-else structure to evaluate a list of student grades. For each grade, determine whether the student has passed or failed based on the grade value.

Instructions:

    Define an array named grades containing a list of student grades.

    Use a for loop to iterate over each grade in the array.

    Inside the loop, use an if-else statement to check if each grade is greater than or equal to 65 (passing). Print "Pass" if the grade is passing and "Fail" if it is not.

Step 3: Integrating Switch Statements with Loops

Create a program that processes multiple orders by their status. Each order can be "Pending," "Shipped," "Delivered," or "Cancelled," and the program will print a message based on the status of each order.

Instructions:

    Define an array named orderStatuses containing different statuses: "Pending," "Shipped," "Delivered," and "Cancelled."

    Use a loop to iterate through the list of order statuses.

    Inside the loop, use a switch statement to print a different message based on the order’s status.

Step 4: Evaluating Student Grades with Switch and Loops

Write a program that uses a for loop to iterate over a list of student scores and a switch statement to assign letter grades based on the score.

Instructions:

    Define an array of student scores.

    Use a for loop to iterate through each score.

    Inside the loop, use a switch statement to assign a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the score.
