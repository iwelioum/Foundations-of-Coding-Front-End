Loop-Based Programming for Repetitive Tasks

Objective:

By the end of this activity, you will be able to write simple loop-based programs using for and while loops. You will also combine loops with control structures like if-else and switch statements to automate repetitive tasks.
Step 1: Using a For Loop to Calculate Total Scores

You are developing a program for a quiz system to calculate the total score of a student based on individual quiz scores. The scores are stored in an array, and you need to use a for loop to sum them up.

Instructions:

    Define an array named scores containing the integers 85, 90, 78, 92, and 88.

    Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array and calculate the total score.

    Print the total score using Console.WriteLine().

     delete the code on the page, add your code into the left hand side, and select run. If you receive an error when you run the code, go to the reading on the next page to compare your code to the correct answer.

Step 2: Using a While Loop to Calculate Factorials

Create a program that calculates the factorial of a given number using a while loop. The program should ask the user for an integer and then calculate its factorial.

Instructions:

    Declare an integer variable number and set its value to 5.

    Use a while loop to calculate the factorial of the number.

    After each iteration, decrement the value of number.

    Print the factorial using Console.WriteLine().

Step 3: Combining Loops and If-Else to Determine Pass or Fail

Write a program that uses a for loop with an if-else structure to check if each student's score meets the passing criteria. A student passes if their score is 50 or above.

Instructions:

    Define an array named studentScores containing the integers 45, 60, 72, 38, and 55.

    Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array.

    Inside the loop, use an if-else statement to check if the score is 50 or above.

    Print "Pass" if the score is 50 or above; otherwise, print "Fail."

Step 4: Combining Loops and Switch Statements for Task Scheduling

Create a program that schedules weekly tasks using a switch statement inside a for loop to assign a task for each day.

Instructions:

    Define an array named weekDays containing the strings "Monday," "Tuesday," "Wednesday," "Thursday," "Friday."

    Use a for loop to iterate over each element in the array.

    Inside the loop, use a switch statement to assign a task to each day:

        If it's "Monday," print "Team Meeting."

        If it's "Tuesday," print "Code Review."

        If it's "Wednesday," print "Development."

        If it's "Thursday," print "Testing."

        If it's "Friday," print "Deployment."
