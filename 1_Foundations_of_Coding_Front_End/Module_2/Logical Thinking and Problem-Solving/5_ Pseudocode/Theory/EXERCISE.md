## Example 1: Writing Pseudocode for a Simple Calculation

### Problem Statement

You need to write a program to calculate the area of a rectangle. The program should take the width and height of the rectangle as input and then calculate and print the area.

### Pseudocode Example

#### Step 1: Define the Problem

The task is to calculate the area of a rectangle using its width and height.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Processes

- Take input for the width of the rectangle.
- Take input for the height of the rectangle.
- Calculate the area using the formula: area = width * height.
- Output the area.

#### Step 3: Explanation

**Initialization:** We start by asking the user to input the width and height of the rectangle.

**Calculation:** The area is calculated using the formula area = width * height.

**Output:** The calculated area is printed.

#### Step 4: Write the Pseudocode
```
Start
Get width
Get height
Set area to width times height
Print area
End
```

## Example 2: Writing Pseudocode for a Conditional Problem

### Problem Statement

Write a program to determine if a person is eligible to vote. The program should take the person's age as input and print "Eligible to vote" if the age is 18 or older, otherwise print "Not eligible to vote".

### Pseudocode Example

#### Step 1: Define the Problem

The task is to check a person's age and determine if they are eligible to vote.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Processes

- Take input for the person's age.
- Check if the age is 18 or older.
- If the age is 18 or older, print "Eligible to vote".
- If the age is less than 18, print "Not eligible to vote".

#### Step 3: Explanation

**Input:** We start by asking the user to input their age.

**Conditional Check:** An if statement checks if the age is 18 or greater.

**Output Based on Condition:** If the condition is true, it prints "Eligible to vote". If false, it prints "Not eligible to vote".

#### Step 4: Write the Pseudocode
```
Start
Get age
If age is greater than or equal to 18
    Then print "Eligible to vote"
Otherwise
    Print "Not eligible to vote"
End
```

## Problem 1

### Problem Statement

Write pseudocode to create a program that calculates the total marks for a student based on marks in three subjects: Math, Science, and English. The program should take input for the marks in each subject, calculate the total, and then print the total marks.

### Instructions

1. Define the problem clearly.
2. Identify the key processes involved in solving the problem.
3. Write pseudocode based on the identified processes.

## Problem 2

### Problem Statement

Write pseudocode to create a program that takes a user's name as input and greets them with a message that says "Hello, [name]!".

### Instructions

1. Define the problem clearly.
2. Identify the key processes involved in solving the problem.
3. Write pseudocode based on the identified processes.
