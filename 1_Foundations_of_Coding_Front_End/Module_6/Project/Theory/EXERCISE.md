# Final Project: Build Your Own Application

## Overview

This project is a culmination of everything you have learned and practiced throughout this course. You will plan, design, and implement a simple program to solve a task.

To start, you'll review two real-world design challenges and pick which you'd like to attempt to solve. Each scenario will include information about the problem and potential ways to use code to solve it.

After making your decision, you'll plan and design your application. You'll go through the three main steps of this process: defining project requirements, setting objectives, and creating a design outline.

Finally, you'll leverage Microsoft Copilot to create code for an application. You now have some experience using Copilot as an assistant when coding. For this project, you can use this AI tool to write, debug, and optimize your code.

These activities are common in development and should allow you to practice and experiment with planning and coding an application. When you have completed your planning, designing, and implementation, you'll submit this project for review.

## Grading Rubric (25 points total)

- **(5pts)** Did you write project requirements and objectives?
- **(5pts)** Did you include a design outline for your project?
- **(5pts)** Does your project code include at least one control structure like if-else and switch statements?
- **(5pts)** Does your project code include at least one loop, like for and while?
- **(5pts)** Does your project code define and call a method?

## Step 1: Review the Design Challenges

There are two design challenges that you can pick from for this project.

### Option 1: Inventory Management System

To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application where users can manage product stock. Users should be able to add new products, update stock, and remove products.

**Key Features:**

- Add new products with name, price, and stock quantity.
- Update stock when products are sold or restocked.
- View all products and their stock levels.
- Remove products from inventory.

### Option 2: Student Grade Management System

To complete this challenge, you will need to create a console application to manage student grades. The system needs to be able to add students, add grades to different students, and calculate average grades for students.

**Key Features:**

- Add new students with names and IDs.
- Assign grades for different subjects.
- Calculate the average grade for each student.
- Display student records with their grades.

Each design challenge should require a similar amount of effort but will require two different approaches. Pick the one that interests you the most and start thinking about the code you might write to solve the problem.

## Step 2: Define the Project Requirements and Objectives

You now know the issue that you're trying to solve. Take some time to determine the project requirements and objectives. Remember, requirements fall into two categories: functional and non-functional. Then, set the project objectives - the specific results you aim to achieve. You'll submit these requirements and objectives at the end of this project.

## Step 3: Create a Design Outline

Next, you'll create a design outline. This process includes breaking the project into tasks and planning the code components needed to accomplish those tasks. Remember, depending on the challenge you chose, you'll want to plan out the variables, methods, control structures, and loops you'll need to accomplish each task your application needs to accomplish.

You should have a diagram or flowchart of your planned application at the end of this process. You also should have a list of each task your application needs to accomplish and what type of code you'll use to accomplish the task. You can include this in your diagram or in a separate document. You can create this documentation using the software of your choice. We recommend using Microsoft Word to complete this task, including the SmartArt diagramming functions, which can help streamline this process. You'll submit this design outline at the end of this project.

## Step 4: Build the Application

With your plan in place, you can begin creating the application using C# in Visual Studio Code. This is the first time you've written code entirely independently, so take your time and review earlier lessons for a refresher.

Also, feel free to leverage Copilot to help you code. Copilot can help you write, analyze, debug, and optimize your code as you're going. Remember that all generative AI tools are meant to work in conjunction with you and require your input and knowledge to complete tasks.

**To show your understanding of the concepts in this course, make sure your code includes:**

- Control structures like if-else and switch statements
- Loops like for and while
- Methods that you define and call

You will submit the code as part of this project after completing the writing, debugging, and optimization of your application.

## Step 5: Save and Submit for Review

Review your project outline and code. Make sure that you have completed the tasks required for this project.

Save your completed project outline and code. When completed, copy and paste the appropriate sections for each of the submission prompts. Great work!
