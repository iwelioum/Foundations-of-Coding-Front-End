Practical Application of Calling Methods

Objective:

By the end of this activity, you will be able to call methods in C# within a complete program. You will gain hands-on experience in defining methods, calling methods with parameters, and using method return values to solve practical problems.
Step 1: Defining and Calling a Simple Method

Create a method that performs a task and call it in a program. This method should print a welcome message to the console.

Instructions:

    Define a method named DisplayWelcomeMessage that prints "Welcome to our Program!" to the console.

    Call the method to display the message.

, delete the code on the page, paste your code into the left-hand side, and select run. If you receive an error when you run the code, go to the reading on the next page to compare your code to the correct answer.
Step 2: Creating a Method with Parameters

Create a method that accepts a parameter to make the method more flexible and reusable. This method should greet a user with a personalized message.

Instructions:

    Define a method GreetUser that accepts a string parameter called name and prints a personalized message like "Hello [name]!".

    Call this method and pass a name as an argument.

Step 3: Using Methods with Return Values

Create a method that returns a value. This method should calculate the sum of two numbers and return the result.

Instructions:

    Define a method CalculateSum that takes two integer parameters and returns their sum.

    Call the method passing two numbers and print the result.

Step 4: Combining Methods and Conditional Logic

Create a method that returns a bool value based on a condition. This method should check if a number is positive.

Instructions:

    Define a method IsPositive that takes an integer as a parameter and returns a bool indicating whether the number is positive.

    Call the method and print whether the number is positive or not.

Step 5: Practical Application – User Age Validation

Create a program to validate user input using methods. This program should ask for the user’s age and check if they are old enough to drive.

Instructions:

    Define a method IsOldEnoughToDrive that takes an integer (age) and returns a bool indicating whether the person is old enough to drive.

    Call the method after asking for the user’s age and display an appropriate message.
