# Activity: Writing Simple Programs in C#

## Objective

Write simple programs in C# that demonstrate basic programming concepts such as classes, methods, loops, and user input.

## Description

This activity guides you through creating three small programs: a simple calculator, a number display loop, and a user input handler. Each step builds on fundamental C# concepts.

## Set Up Your Environment

Use the Visual Studio Code console application you created at the start of the course. Paste your code into the `Program.cs` file in that application (be sure to delete any existing code first). If you receive an error when you run the code, go to the reading on the next page to compare your code to the correct answer.

## Step 1: Creating a Simple Calculator

Create a simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition. This exercise involves defining a class and writing a method to add two numbers.

### Instructions

1. Define a class called `Calculator`.
2. Inside the class, declare two integer variables to hold the numbers.
3. Write a method called `Add` that adds two numbers and returns the result.

---

## Step 2: Executing the Calculator Program

Write a `Main` method to execute the calculator program. This method will assign values to the numbers and call the `Add` method.

### Instructions

1. Write the `Main` method inside the `Calculator` class.
2. Assign values to `number1` and `number2`.
3. Call the `Add` method and print the result using `Console.WriteLine`.

## Step 3: Creating a Loop to Display Numbers

Write a program that uses a loop to display numbers from 1 to 10. Loops allow you to repeat actions multiple times.

### Instructions

1. Define a class called `NumberDisplay`.
2. Write a method called `DisplayNumbers` that uses a `for` loop to print numbers from 1 to 10.
3. Call the `DisplayNumbers` method inside the `Main` method.

## Step 4: Handling User Input

Write a program that interacts with the user. This program will prompt the user for their name and greet them.

### Instructions

1. Define a class called `UserInput`.
2. Write a method called `GreetUser` that prompts the user to enter their name and stores the input in a variable.
3. Print a greeting message that includes the user's name.
