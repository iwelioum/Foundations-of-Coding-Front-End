# Activity: Tackling Coding Challenges with Copilot

## Objective

Use Microsoft Copilot to extend the Library Management System by solving new challenges, such as searching for a book or limiting the number of books that can be borrowed. You should use the code you've already optimized in the previous "You Try It!" activity to complete this activity. At the end of this course, you'll submit this code as your final project.

## Problem Statement

The Library Management System works well, but it can be extended to solve new problems. You need to add the following features:

1. Search for a book by its title.
2. Limit the number of books a user can borrow at once.

With Microsoft Copilot, you will solve these new challenges and extend the functionality of the system.

## Step 2: Limit Borrowing

### Instructions

1. Add a feature that tracks how many books a user has borrowed.
2. Limit the number of books to 3 at a time.

## Step 3: Check-in a Borrowed Book

### Instructions

1. Add a feature that enables the user to check in a book that's been checked out.
2. Check if the book is checked out. If it is, remove the checked-out flag to check the book in. If it isn't, inform the user.

## Step 4: Test the New Features

### Instructions

1. Run the program and test the search and borrowing limit functionalities with different inputs.

When completed, save your code. You will use this code to complete the final project in this course.
