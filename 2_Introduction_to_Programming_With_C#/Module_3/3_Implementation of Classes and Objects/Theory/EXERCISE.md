# Activity: Implementation of Classes and Objects

## Objective

Create and use classes and objects in C# to understand the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

## Description

This activity guides you through creating a `Person` class with properties and methods, then creating objects from that class to demonstrate how classes and objects work together.

## Set Up Your Environment

Use the Visual Studio Code console application you created at the start of the course. Remove any existing code in the `Program.cs` file of your console application and create all the code in each step in that file.

---

## Step 1: Prepare for the Application

You'll create a small application that demonstrates creating a greeting method using classes and objects.

---

## Step 2: Creating a Basic Class

In the `Program.cs` file, define a class called `Person` that includes properties to represent a person's characteristics.

### Instructions

1. Define a class called `Person`.
2. Create two properties: `Name` (a string) and `Age` (an integer).

---

## Step 3: Creating Objects

Create objects from the `Person` class and assign values to their properties.

### Instructions

1. Create two objects of the `Person` class.
2. Assign different values to their `Name` and `Age` properties.

---

## Step 4: Creating Methods

Add a method to the `Person` class that performs an action, like printing a greeting.

### Instructions

1. Update the `Person` class by writing a method called `Greet`.
2. Make this method print a message that includes the person's name.

---

## Step 5: Using Methods in Objects

Call the method on each `Person` object to perform an action.

### Instructions

1. Update the `Main` method to call the `Greet` method on each `Person` object to print a personalized greeting.
2. To check your answer, run the Visual Studio Code console application.

---

## Step 6: Practicing with Multiple Objects

Create additional objects from the same class and use methods on them to see how each behaves independently.

### Instructions

1. Update the `Main` method by creating a third `Person` object.
2. Assign a different name and age to this object.
3. Call the `Greet` method on this new object.
4. To check your answer, run the Visual Studio Code console application.
